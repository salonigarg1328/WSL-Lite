# 🐧 WSL Lite — Modern UI for Windows Subsystem Setup

**WSL Lite** is a sleek, minimal React-based interface designed to make setting up and managing lightweight WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environments simple and intuitive.  
It provides predefined profiles (CLI Lite, Dev Lite, and Data Lite) and lets you build your own custom environments with just a few clicks.

## 🚀 Features

- **🧱 Predefined Profiles**
  - **CLI Lite** – Minimal shell environment with essential tools like `bash`, `curl`, `git`, and `python3`.  
  - **Dev Lite** – Developer-focused setup with compilers, build tools, and Node.js.  
  - **Data Lite** – Lightweight Python stack for data workflows (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).

- **🧩 Custom Profile Builder**  
  Pick and install exactly the packages you need using the custom selection interface.

- **💡 Dynamic Hover Popups**  
  Instantly preview each profile’s toolset with elegant Framer Motion animations.

- **⚙️ Smooth Install Flow**  
  Installs run via a backend (`/install-profile` endpoint), with real-time logs and progress tracking.

- **🎨 Modern UI Stack**
  - Built with **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**
  - Responsive design and fluid transitions
  - Icons dynamically rendered for each package
